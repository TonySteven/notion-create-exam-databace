        "title": "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'd gone up to the city, my husband and I, to see a friend of his from college. He was doing well for himself now, a businessman living in a high-class apartment on the Magnificent Mile. It was a treat for us to get away like this, on the rare occasions we could get a baby-sitter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He met us at the parking garage (停车库) he'd recommended (推荐) and offered to pay for. \"City life's great,\" he'd said, \"except for finding a parking space.\" There was the slap on the back for my husband, and a kiss on the cheek for me. Then he led us out to the street for the two-block walk to his apartment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Side reminded me of a refined street festival that summer night – crowds of people, somehow looking well-dressed even in jeans, strolling up and down the sidewalks, stopping in at the dozens of restaurants.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were walking three abreast (并肩) downthe sidewalk. I was on the inside, closest to the buildings, and I saw him out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was old, sitting on the doorstep of a store already locked for the night. He was bundled up in a dirty jacket that looked way too heavy for summer. Every few seconds, he called out to the passing people. \"Got a quarter?\" \"Can you spare some change?\"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'd seen people like him before, of course. We'd learned not to look them in the eye, to close our ears, to walk on by. Usually they expected to be ignored. Some of them tried to make you feel guilty (内疚), though, by telling you they needed money to feed their kids.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I steeled myself as we approached him. \"Got any loose change you can spare?\" he piped up.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Get lost!\" our friend shouted, looking straight ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we brushed by, I got a look at him. Gray hair; a creased (有皱痕的), worn face that, inexplicably (无法解释地), had a toothless smile on it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we were past him, not missing a step in our steady stride. \"I get so sick of these guys leeching off of you,\" our friend grumbled under his breath.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slowed down, my steps faltering (犹豫). I had some change in my pocket. I could get it out, run back, drop it into the old man's hand, and catch up with the guys before they even knew I was gone. Or I could just tell them, \"I'll be right back, guys; wait for me a second,\" and go back at my leisure. But then I'd have to listen to the lecture about being too soft-hearted and handing out money to any guy with a sob story to tell.</p><p><br></p>",

        "title": "<p>The good news we get from TV and radio makes us feel more kindly toward other people, but bad news — especially news of cruelty and violence — stirs up suspicion and a sense of competition toward others.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the findings of 10 years of experiments by research psychologists (心理学家) at Columbia University, who conclude that broadcasters encourage hostile (敌对的) behavior by stressing bad news.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We found that the news people are exposed to either encourages them to concentrate on the differences between themselves and others, or on the common problems that make them feel, 'We're all in this together,' \" explained Dr. Harvey Hornstein.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"'News about one human being helping another … brings out feelings of trust and cooperation. But news about one personactually doing harm to another changes our estimate of other people for the worse.\"”</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an early experiment in 1968, Dr. Hornstein and his associates, who had been dropping wallets (钱包) for two years to test the honesty of people, discovered that on June 4, 1968, not one wallet was returned.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That was the night Robert F. Kennedy was shot,\" he recalled. \"Strangers suddenly seemed dangerous, and nobody wanted to return a lost wallet to a stranger.\"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But good news on the other hand, lifts us up,\" he stressed, citing the date of July 4, 1976, America’s Bicentennial (两百年的) celebration. \"On that day, we all felt safe and good. Being American was the thing. We all felt as if we all belonged together.\"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent tests support these conclusions. In one experiment, 60 subjects were exposed to good news, bad news or music. Then they were told to play a game with a non-existent person supposedly in another room. It was a game of choice that emphasized cooperation or competition.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing good news, the overwhelming majority, 91 percent, played cooperatively. But after hearing bad news, competitive responses were over three times as high — up to 28 percent, from 9 percent.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If we watch television and see a lot of blood,\" said Dr. Hornstein, \"we’re probably assuming that the world is a dirtier place than we assumed before we saw that TV violence. And we’ll deal with the next individual we come upon as if he is part of that grim (冷酷的) picture of humanity. After the good news, it’s the reverse.\"</p><p><br></p>",

        "title": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">　Perhaps you are an average student with average intelligence. You do well enough in school, but you probably think you will never be a top student. This is not necessarily the case, however. You can receive better grades if you want to. Yes, even students of average intelligence can be top students without additional work. Here’s how:</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> 1. Plan your time carefully. Make a list of your weekly tasks. Then make a schedule or chart of your time. Fill in committed time such as eating, sleeping, meetings, classes, etc. Then decide on good, regular times for studying. Be sure to set aside enough time to complete your normal reading and work assignments. Of course, studying shouldn’t occupy all of the free time on the schedule. It’s important to set aside time for relaxation, hobbies, and entertainment as well. This weekly schedule may not solve all of your problems, but it will make you more aware of how you spend your time. Furthermore, it will enable you to plan your activities so that you have adequate time for both work and play.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> 2. Find a good place to study. Choose one place for your study area. It may be a deck or a chair at home or in the school library, but it should be comfortable, and it should not have distractions. When you begin to work, you should be able to concentrate on the subject.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> 3. Skim before you read. This means looking over a passage quickly before you begin to read it more carefully. As you preview the material, you get some idea of the content and how it is organized. Later when you begin to read you will recognize less important material and you may skip some of these portions. Skimming helps double your reading speed and improves your comprehension as well.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> 4. Make good use of your time in class. Listening to what the teacher says in class means less work later. Sit where you can see and hear well. Take notes to help you remember what the teacher says.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> 5. Study regularly. Go over your notes as soon as you can after class. Review important points mentioned in class as well as points you remain confused about. Read about these points in your textbook. If you know what the teacher will discuss the next day, skim and read that material too. This will help you understand the next class. If you review your notes and textbook regularly, the material will become more meaningful and you will remember it longer. Regular review leads to improved performance on tests.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> 6. Develop a good attitude about tests. The purpose of a test is to show what you have learned about a subject. The world won’t end if you don’t pass a test, so don’t worry excessively about a sin le test. Tests provide grades, but they also let you know what you need to spend more time studying, and they help make your new knowledge permanent.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> There are other techniques that might help you with your studying. Only a few have been mentioned here. You will probably discover many others after you have tried these. Talk with your classmates about their study techniques. Share with them some of the techniques you have found to be helpful. Improving your study habits will improve your grades.</span></p>",

        "title": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">　Many of us believe that a person's mind becomes less active as he grows older. But this is not true, according to Dr. Jarvik, professor of psychiatry at the University of California. She has studied the mental functioning of aging persons for several years. For example, one of her studies concerns 136 pairs of identical twins, who were first examined when they were already 60 years old. As Dr. Jarvik continued the study of the twins into their 70s and 80s, their minds did not generally decline as was expected.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> However, there was some decline in their psycho-motor speed. This means that it took them longer to accomplish mental tasks than it used to. But when speed was not a factor, they lost very little intellectual ability over the years. In general, Dr. Jarvik 's studies have shown that there is no decline in knowledge or reasoning ability. This is true not only with those in their 30s and 40s, but with those in their 60s and 70s as well.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> It is true that older people themselves often complain that their memory is not as good as it once was. However, much of what we call \"loss of memory\" is not that at all. They usually are incomplete learning in the first place. For example, the older person perhaps had trouble hearing, or poor vision, or inattention, or was trying to learn the new thing at too fast a pace. In the cases where the older person's mind really seems to decay, it’s not necessarily a sign of decay due to old age. Often it is simply a sign of depressed emotional state.</span></p>",
