        "title": "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do young children learn to have good values How can parents teach their children about the importance of kindness, patience, and self-discipline At a time when more and more parents worry about the negative and violent images (暴力形象) their children see on TV, in the movies and, on the Internet, some are turning to fairy tales (童话) as a way to teach their young ones how to behave in society.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy tales were not always intended for children. We know this because some of these stories have existed for hundreds of years and were passed down from generation to generation through songs and drama. They were considered entertainment for everyone, not only for young people. In these ancient stories, the heroes were extremely clever, fiercely independent, and never gave up. Over the years, some of the heroes' qualities and story lines have been changed to fit the times.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychologists think that fairy tales have a positive influence on children because they present the two sides of good and evil very clearly. When children hear the stories, they develop sympathetic feelings for the heroic characters. In each tale, they can see that there are many different kinds of people in the world and that we all have a choice about what kind of person we want to be. We can choose to do good actions, rather than bad ones, in our lives.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of values can children learn from fairy tales in \"The Princess and the Pea,\" a poorly dressed girl who insists she is a princess is given a difficult test by the Queen. When she passes the test, we learn that she is rewarded because she stayed true to herself. In \"The Little Mermaid,\" the mermaid (美人鱼) who lives under the sea longs to be with the humans on land. Through her experiences, we learn about the importance of living with and accepting other cultures. In \"Pinocchio,\" a wooden puppet (木偶) turns into a boy when he finally learns how to tell the truth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching values is the reason most often given for teaching literature and encouraging reading. These old stories can indeed teach us lessons about human relationships that are universal (普遍的) enough to survive throughout the centuries. This might be the reason why they have been around for so long and are unlikely to disappear any time soon.</p><p><br></p>",

But news about one personactually doing harm to another changes our estimate of other people for the worse.\"”</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an early experiment in 1968, Dr. Hornstein and his associates, who had been dropping wallets (钱包) for two years to test the honesty of people, discovered that on June 4, 1968, not one wallet was returned.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That was the night Robert F. Kennedy was shot,\" he recalled. \"Strangers suddenly seemed dangerous, and nobody wanted to return a lost wallet to a stranger.\"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But good news on the other hand, lifts us up,\" he stressed, citing the date of July 4, 1976, America’s Bicentennial (两百年的) celebration. \"On that day, we all felt safe and good. Being American was the thing. We all felt as if we all belonged together.\"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent tests support these conclusions. In one experiment, 60 subjects were exposed to good news, bad news or music. Then they were told to play a game with a non-existent person supposedly in another room. It was a game of choice that emphasized cooperation or competition.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing good news, the overwhelming majority, 91 percent, played cooperatively.

And we’ll deal with the next individual we come upon as if he is part of that grim (冷酷的) picture of humanity. After the good news, it’s the reverse.\"</p><p><br></p>",

The cash register showed her I needed 99 cents, but she couldn’t figure out how to count out the coins.” I understood Mike’s concern. What we have done in this country, although unintentionally, is to create several generations of individuals most of whom have no idea how to reason; how to do simple math; how to do research; or finally, how to be creative. The reason for this is our overuse of information technology: video games, television, digital watches, calculators, and computers. Information technology feeds us information without requiring us to think about it and let us perform operations without understanding them.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> It is time we took a hard look at an educational system that only teaches our children how o push buttons. Our kids can’t tell time if the clock has hands. They can use calculators, but cannot add, subtract, divide, or multiply. Video games have taken the place of active, imaginative play. Although most of them are technically literate, they choose not to read. They are so used to television and movies that they cannot use their imagination to stay interested in a book.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> It is not enough to recognize that a problem exists. What we need is a solution. The one I offer is simple to suggest, but may be impossible to carry out. We must unplug our children. If we don’t, they will never learn how to solve problem. They will never learn even basic reasoning skills and will certainly not develop creativity. Instead of filling classrooms with electronics, let’s concentrate on food old-fashioned literacy——reading books. Students must be taught not to perform computer operations by rote, but to figure and reason for themselves. They must see how things work and how processes lead to results, they must also stretch their imagination.</span></p>",

        "title": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">　Many of us believe that a person's mind becomes less active as he grows older. But this is not true, according to Dr. Jarvik, professor of psychiatry at the University of California. She has studied the mental functioning of aging persons for several years. For example, one of her studies concerns 136 pairs of identical twins, who were first examined when they were already 60 years old. As Dr. Jarvik continued the study of the twins into their 70s and 80s, their minds did not generally decline as was expected.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> However, there was some decline in their psycho-motor speed. This means that it took them longer to accomplish mental tasks than it used to. But when speed was not a factor, they lost very little intellectual ability over the years. In general, Dr. Jarvik 's studies have shown that there is no decline in knowledge or reasoning ability. This is true not only with those in their 30s and 40s, but with those in their 60s and 70s as well.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> It is true that older people themselves often complain that their memory is not as good as it once was. However, much of what we call \"loss of memory\" is not that at all. They usually are incomplete learning in the first place. For example, the older person perhaps had trouble hearing, or poor vision, or inattention, or was trying to learn the new thing at too fast a pace. In the cases where the older person's mind really seems to decay, it’s not necessarily a sign of decay due to old age. Often it is simply a sign of depressed emotional state.</span></p>",
